# Data-Science

This repository is a reflection of the projects I have been working on to further my knowledge in and around data science. I am intrigued specifically by unstructured data such as images. Most of these projects are related to Kaggle competitions, others were created at work (with obscured data) while the rest are personal projects I take an interest in.
